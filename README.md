# nifty-engulfing-detect
This project implements a **real-time scanner** that detects the **Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern** on **Nifty 50 stocks** using Zerodha's Kite Connect API.

The goal is to assist in identifying intraday or multi-timeframe (MTF) trade triggers. Currently, signals are logged for manual execution, with plans for future automation once MTF support is provided by Kite Connect.

## What is a Bullish Engulfing Pattern?

A **Bullish Engulfing** pattern is a two-candle reversal signal that typically appears after a downtrend:
- The first candle is bearish (red).
- The second candle is bullish (green) and **completely engulfs** the body of the previous candle.

It suggests a potential shift in momentum from sellers to buyers.
